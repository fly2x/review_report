    "problem": "The Java constant `RSA_MAX_BITS` was updated to 4096, but the corresponding C definition `RSAref_MAX_BITS` in `sdf4j/src/main/native/include/sdf_types.h` (not included in this PR) remains 2048. This causes `java_to_native_RSAPrivateKey` in `type_conversion.c` to truncate 4096-bit keys to 2048 bits (256 bytes) when copying to the fixed-size native struct. Furthermore, when these native structs (with `bits=4096` but only 256 bytes of space for `m`) are passed to SDF functions, it leads to buffer over-reads or stack corruption as the SDF implementation expects 512 bytes based on the bit length.",

While GCM/CCM `Final` typically outputs only the final partial block (<= 16 bytes), relying on this exact size is dangerous. If the underlying SDF implementation buffers more data (e.g., a full block + partial) or behaves differently, writing more than 16 bytes to `output_buf` will cause a stack buffer overflow.",
