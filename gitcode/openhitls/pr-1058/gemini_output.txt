I will start by listing the changed files and their statistics to confirm the scope of the PR, and then I will examine the diffs for each file to identify any issues.
I will read the differences for `README.md` and `README-zh.md` to check for any inconsistencies or errors in the main documentation.
I will read `configure.py` to verify the valid `asm_type` values, confirming whether `x8664` is a valid option or a typo.
I will read `config/json/feature.json` to verify the valid values for `asm_type`, specifically checking if `x8664` is supported.
I will read the English documentation files `docs/en/1_Release Notes.md`, `docs/en/2_Key Features.md`, and `docs/en/6_Appendix/2_Change History.md` to identify any issues or inconsistencies.
I will examine the Chinese documentation files `docs/zh/1_发行声明.md`, `docs/zh/2_关键特性.md`, and `docs/zh/6_附录/2_修订记录.md` to identify any issues, while also verifying if the Chinese "Change History" file was deleted like its English counterpart.
I will verify the inconsistencies and typos found in `README.md`, `README-zh.md`, and `docs/zh/1_发行声明.md`, including mixed delimiters, inconsistent capitalization, missing punctuation, and the deletion of the "Change History" files. Then, I will generate the issue report.

===ISSUE===
FILE: README.md
LINE: 14
SEVERITY: low
TITLE: Mixed delimiters in feature list
PROBLEM: The line uses a Chinese-style enumeration comma (、) instead of an English comma (,).
CODE:
```
- Authentication: Support Privacy Pass、HOTP、TOTP、SPAKE2+.
```
FIX:
```
- Authentication: Support Privacy Pass, HOTP, TOTP, SPAKE2+.
```

FILE: README.md
LINE: 19
SEVERITY: low
TITLE: Inconsistent capitalization
PROBLEM: The item "random" starts with a lowercase letter, while other items in the list start with uppercase (e.g., "Symmetric algorithms", "Post-quantum algorithms").
CODE:
```
   - random: DRBG, DRBG-GM
```
FIX:
```
   - Random: DRBG, DRBG-GM
```

   - 密钥派生：HKDF，SCRYPT，PBKDF2
   - 哈希算法：SHA系列，MD5，SM3
   - 消息认证码：HMAC，CMAC
   - 其他：HPKE
```
FIX:
```
