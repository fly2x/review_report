Now I've verified all the issues. Let me compile the consolidated report:

===ISSUE===
FILE: README.md
LINE: 8
SEVERITY: high
TITLE: Unverified ISO19790 certification claim in README
REVIEWERS: CODEX
CONFIDENCE: trusted
PROBLEM: The new text asserts "ISO19790 certified," which is a compliance/legal claim not supported by any certification artifacts in this repo (only an ISO19790 Provider implementation exists in the codebase). This can mislead users and conflicts with the release notes wording which says "ISO19790 Provider" rather than "certified."
CODE:
```
The architecture of openHiTLS is highly modular, and openHiTLS can be configured in modules and features. The RAM/ROM footprint depends on the features selected. It provides the optimal performance optimization for cryptographic algorithms. Currently, 5 components and cryptographic algorithms are configured, ISO19790 certified, and the performance optimization of ShangMi cryptographic algorithms on ARM, x86 is ready. More architectures and features are to be planned.
```
FIX:

TITLE: Unverified ISO19790 certification claim in Chinese README
REVIEWERS: CODEX
CONFIDENCE: trusted
PROBLEM: The Chinese text asserts "已经通过ISO19790认证" (already passed ISO19790 certification), which is a compliance/legal claim not supported by any certification artifacts in this repo. The release notes correctly say "新增ISO19790 Provider" (added ISO19790 Provider), not certification.
CODE:
```
openHiTLS架构高度模块化，可通过模块和特性配置。RAM/ROM尺寸取决于所选的特性。openHiTLS为密码算法提供最佳性能优化。当前已支持5个组件和算法特性可按需配置，已经通过ISO19790认证，支持ARM、x86架构CPU上的算法性能优化，更多架构和特性待规划。
```

SEVERITY: medium
TITLE: STM32F407 build configuration claim not backed by repo
REVIEWERS: CODEX
CONFIDENCE: trusted
PROBLEM: The release notes claim "STM32F407 build configuration," but there is no STM32F407-specific toolchain/config in config/toolchain (only generic arm-none-eabi-gcc.cmake exists). This misleads users looking for a concrete STM32F407 config.
CODE:
```
### Performance and Platform
* SM2/SM3 ARMv7 assembly optimization
* Darwin/macOS cross-platform support
* STM32F407 build configuration
```
FIX:
```

TITLE: STM32F407编译配置表述与仓库不符
REVIEWERS: CODEX
CONFIDENCE: trusted
PROBLEM: The Chinese release notes claim "新增STM32F407编译配置" (added STM32F407 build configuration), but the repository only has a generic arm-none-eabi toolchain, not STM32F407-specific configuration.

```
### 性能与平台
* SM2/SM3 ARMv7汇编优化
* 新增Darwin/macOS跨平台支持
* 新增STM32F407编译配置

FILE: docs/index/index.md
LINE: 12, 16
SEVERITY: low
TITLE: Broken links to deleted Change History files
REVIEWERS: CODEX
CONFIDENCE: trusted
PROBLEM: The docs/index/index.md still links to "修订记录" (Change History) files at ../zh/6_附录/2_修订记录.md and ../en/6_Appendix/2_Change History.md, but these files were deleted in this PR, resulting in broken links.
CODE:
```
| 12   | [修订记录](../zh/6_附录/2_修订记录.md)     | [Change History](../en/6_Appendix/2_Change%20History.md) |
```
FIX:
```
Remove or update the links to point to the Release Notes files instead:
| 12   | [发行声明](../zh/1_发行声明.md)     | [Release Notes](../en/1_Release%20Notes.md) |

SEVERITY: medium
TITLE: Inconsistent architecture naming in comment vs command parameter
REVIEWERS: CLAUDE
CONFIDENCE: trusted
PROBLEM: The comment says "x86_64 Optimize the full build:" but the actual command parameter is `--asm_type x8664`. Users may be confused and try to use `--asm_type x86_64` which would fail.
CODE:
```
* x86_64 Optimize the full build:
```
python3 ../configure.py --enable hitls_bsl hitls_crypto hitls_tls hitls_pki hitls_auth --lib_type static --bits=64 --system=linux --asm_type x8664
```
```
FIX:

TITLE: Missing punctuation mark in Chinese documentation
REVIEWERS: CLAUDE

PROBLEM: Line 28 is missing a semicolon or period at the end, while all other items in the list end with a semicolon, creating inconsistent formatting.
